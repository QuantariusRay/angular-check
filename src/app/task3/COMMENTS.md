After making it to task 4 I realized that Task 3 probably would want to display the task groups. The requirements don't
explicitly state one way or another to show them, just to categorize them by a group. The first thought is, "Why add a 
group if you're not going to display it?" But that will lead us to a great discussion on enterprise development and the
silly things we do only to come back later and make changes.
